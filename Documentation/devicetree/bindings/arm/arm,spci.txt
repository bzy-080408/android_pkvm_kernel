Secure Partition Client Interface
---------------------------------

Firmware frameworks implementing partition setup according to the SPCI described
in ARM document number ARM DEN 0077A ("Secure Partition Client Interface
Specification") [0] must provide a "manifest and image" for each partition to
the "partition manager" so that the partition execution contexts can be
initialised.

In the case of a virtual SPCI instance, the manifest and image details can be
passed to the hypervisor (e.g. Linux KVM) using this binding.

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be one of:
	       "arm,spci-0.9-hypervisor"

- memory-region : A phandle to the reserved memory region [1] to be used by the
		  hypervisor. The reserved memory region must be compatible with
		  "arm,spci-0.9-hypervisor-memory-region".

- One or more child nodes, each describing an SPCI partition using the following
  required properties:

  - compatible: Should be one of:
		"arm,spci-0.9-partition"

  - uuid : The 128-bit UUID [2] of the service implemented by this partition,
	   represented as a string.

  - nr-exec-ctxs : The number of virtual CPUs to instantiate for this partition.

  - exec-state : The execution state in which to execute the partition. Should
		 be "AArch64" or "AArch32".

  - entry-point : The entry address of the partition specified as an
		  Intermediate Physical Address (IPA).

  - memory-region : A list of phandles to SPCI reserved memory regions as
		    described in [3].
