Secure Partition Client Interface Memory Region
-----------------------------------------------

This binding allows a firmware framework to describe the normal memory regions
of a partition to a hypervisor.
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/arm,spci.txt for more information.

The physical address range reserved for the partition can be specified as a
static allocation using the 'reg' property or as a dynamic allocation using the
'size' property. If both properties are omitted, then the hypervisor can
allocate physical memory for the partition however it sees fit.
See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt for
more information.

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be one of:
	       "arm,spci-0.9-partition-memory-region"

Optional properties:

- ipa-range : The Intermediate Physical Address (IPA) range where the memory
	      described by the "reg" property should be mapped at stage 2. If
	      the IPA range is larger than the memory region then the region is
	      mapped starting at the base of the IPA range.

- read-only : (static allocation only) The memory region has been pre-populated
	      by the firmware framework and must be mapped without write
	      permission at stage 2.

- non-executable : The memory region must be mapped without execute permission
		   at stage 2.

Example:

	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <2>;
		#size-cells = <2>;
		ranges;

		spci_reserved0: spci_mem@100000000 {
			compatible = "arm,spci-0.9-partition-memory-region";
			reg = <0x1 0x0 0x0 0x04000000>;		// 64M @ 1GB

			ipa-range = <0x0 0x0 0x0 0x04000000>;	// 64M @ 0x0
			read-only;
		};
	};
